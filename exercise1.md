As far as linting goes, there are many linters for Python. There are even so called 'combo linters' which combine multiple linters into one package. Flake8 and Pylama are examples of such combo linters, both of which can cover both logical and stylistic linting. When it comes to testing, Python comes with the 'unittest' framework, a 'JUnit' inspired unit testing framework which supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of tests from the reporting framework. Building and distributing packages in Python is done with the 'Setuptools' library, which is designed to facilitate the packaging of Python projects.  

Some on premise alternatives to Jenkins are GitLab-CI and TeamCity. Some cloud alternatives to Github Actions are Amazon's AWS CodePipeline, Google's Cloud Build, and Microsoft's Azure Pipelines.

Based on the relatively small team size of 6 and the fact that the application is near release, I would tend to say that the CI/CD solution would be better served from a cloud based environment. This is because there is much less configuration, and thus, time and resources required to get everything up and running so the team can focus on the application. However, if the application has any special requirements or hardware, such as a GPU, then a self hosted CI setup may be required.
